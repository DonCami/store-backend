# Store backend

> [!NOTE]
> This backend will be replaced by a real backend in the future.

This is a fake data backend for the store. It is a simple REST API that stores data from json-server.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Start the server

```bash
yarn start
```

actually the backend runs on port 3001, if you want to change the port, you can change it in the `package.json` file.
